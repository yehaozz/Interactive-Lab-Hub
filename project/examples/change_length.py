# qwiic_led_stick_ex9_change_length.py
#
# This example changes the length of the attached LED strip and shows the results 
# by writing the whole strip white. Length will not reset on restart, change back
# to 10 if necessary with my_stick.change_length(10);
# If you add LEDs to the end of the sitck, you must change the length to be able to
# use them.
