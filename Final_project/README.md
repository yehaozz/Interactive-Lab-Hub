# Lit Up

_Lit Up_ is a comprehensive system with mood detection, powered by machine learning, music recommendation, and audio visualization. The system recommends music based on the user's mood, and respond to the music's rhythm with LEDs. We hope the user's can lighten up with Lit Up!

## Motivation & Design
Explain why we implement our project. Include our storyboard. Maybe include motto?

The main purpose behind implementing this project was how students, especially towards the end of the semester, would be going through a lot of stress. So this tool would help a student or any person that is busy working on something and is anxious or stressed to lighten up based on how theyâ€™re feeling without having to waste time on choosing music by answering if they would like the music to change their mood or accompany it. Things are made more interesting by including a music visualizer LED strip to accompany the music. There is also the option of using just the music visualizer for party purposes without using the emotion detector to control it. This makes the usability of the device very flexible for the user to interact with in different scenarios.

## Features & Demo
What makes our project stand out? (mood detector, visualzier, controller)

**Include _video_ of interaction**

## Hardware Setup
### Parts Needed
Include a list/table of parts we used. May be better if images are included.

1. Raspberry Pi

    We used Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

2. LED strip

    We used WS2812B LED strip. This project is also compatible with Adafruit NeoPixel.

4. Web camera

    We used a web camera to capture user's facial expressions for the mood detection task.

6. 5V Power Supply

    A 5V AC/DC adaptor was used to supply power for the LED strip.
