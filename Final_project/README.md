# Project title
A short overview of our project. Maybe include a quickly designed logo?

## Motivation & Design
Explain why we implement our project. Include our storyboard. Maybe include motto?
 
## Features & Demo
What makes our project stand out? (mood detector, visualzier, controller)

**Include _video_ of interaction**

[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
## Hardware Setup
### Parts Needed
Include a list/table of parts we used. May be better if images are included.

1. Raspberry Pi

    We used Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

2. LED strip

    We used WS2812B LED strip. This project is also compatible with Adafruit NeoPixel.

3. Microphone

    We used a USB microphone to capture audio input.

6. 5V Power Supply

    A 5V AC/DC adaptor was used to supply power for the LED strip.

### Raspberry Pi Wiring
Explain how all the parts are wired up with the RasPi

## Dependency Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a environment running.

## Configuration & Tests
Describe how to test both hardware and denpendencies are properly set up.

## Let the Interaction Begin
Show how to run the controller, mood detector, audio visualizer.

## Credits
Give proper credits. Cite any repos, blogposts, videos, (people?) that help with our implementation

## Reflections
What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?

Leave it here to remind us that we should submit reflections on Canvas.
